Summary
-------
A JSON parser library written in C

Building/Installation
---------------------
See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Briefly, first run the autogen.sh script.
Then, building is as simple as
	`./configure && make && make install`

Run `make check` to complete the suite of self-tests

Details
-------
The library operates on UTF-8 encoded JSON texts.

A simple example of parsing a JSON source:

json_parser_state* parserState = json_parser_init(NULL, NULL);
json_value* topVal = json_parser_parse(parserState, jsonStr, jsonStrLen);

UTF-16 surrogate pairs encoded as \uXXXX\uXXXX are unencoded in
JSON strings to a UTF-8 representation.
